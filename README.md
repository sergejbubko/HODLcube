  - 2 pcs 3x4 mm
  - 2 pcs 2x3 mm
- piece of PCB, size 5x7 holes - cut 14x5 in half with shears or bench shear

### You will also need
- 3D printer
- PLA and/or PETG filaments
- soldering iron
- solder
- patience

###3D printing
1. Print top part of the HODLcube from white translucent filament. White PETG from Sunlu is recommended. It depends on your your experience. This part has to be translucent but don't have to be transparent. LED light have to go through easily.
2. Print the rest five parts from PLA/PETG filament, colour of your choice

###Soldering, see scheme
1. Solder LEDs and resistors on top of cutted 5x7 PCB
2. Solder buzzer and all wires on the other side of PCB
3. All negatives (buzzer, resistors should lead to one negative wire)
4. Now solder all wires from PCB to holes in D1 mini board
5. Solder 4 Dupont male cables

### Assembly
1. Push the LEDs into top 3D printed part the way it is not overlap the part itself
2. Put the D1 mini board onto bottom part and use two smaller screws to catch it on place
3. The display should snap on front part, use two bigger screws on upper part
4. Now put left, bottom, top and right part together. If it doesn't fit well use sharp knife or sandpaper. The reset button on D1 mini should face the small hole in left part.
5. Snap on the front part. If it is too hard to snap it in use drill bit and adjust holes for the pins.
6. Connect all 4 wires to display and snap in tha back part.
